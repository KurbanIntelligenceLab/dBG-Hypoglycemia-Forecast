# A reinforcement learning approach to effective forecasting of pediatric hypoglycemia in diabetes I patients using an extended de Bruijn graph

This repository contains a Python implementation of our reinforcement learning forecasting model based on the de Bruijn graph.

Refer to `dBGEvaluation.ipynb` for a guide on how to run our code.

Tested with Python 3.10 but, it will probably work most 3.x versions. To download the dependencies:


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
